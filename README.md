# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based solution designed to detect plant leaf diseases from images. It classifies leaves into **three categories**:  
✅ Healthy  
⚠️ Powdery Mildew  
⚠️ Rust

This tool can help farmers and agriculturalists identify common diseases early and take preventive action.
